<b>TRIfA - A New Kind of Instant Messaging</b><br>

Whether it's corporations or governments, digital surveillance today is widespread.<br>
Tox is easy-to-use software that connects you with friends and family without anyone else listening in.<br>
While other big-name services require you to pay for features, Tox is completely free and comes without advertising — forever.<br><br>

<b>Encrypted:</b><br>
Everything you do with Tox is encrypted using open-source libraries. The only people who can see your conversations are the people you're talking with.<br><br>

<b>Distributed:</b><br>
Tox has no central servers that can be raided, shut down, or forced to turn over data — the network is made up of its users. Say goodbye to server outages!<br><br>

<b>Free:</b><br>
Tox is free software. That's free as in freedom, as well as in price. This means Tox is yours — to use, modify, and share — because Tox is developed by and for the users.<br><br>
